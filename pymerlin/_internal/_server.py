"""
In-process model runtime for the PyMerlin shim, called directly by GraalBridge (Java) via
GraalPy host calls — no subprocess, no protocol, no queues.

An activity runs on the calling Java `ThreadedTask` thread. `delay`/`call` call straight
back into a Java host object (`java_actions`); emits route through `CellRef.emit` →
`java_actions.emitCell` (Phase 4, roadmap §7); `wait_until` passes the Python predicate to
`java_actions.waitUntil` as a `BooleanSupplier` and the engine re-evaluates it when cell
dependencies change (no polling); `spawn` schedules a fresh child `ThreadedTask` via
`java_actions.spawnActivity`. `CellRef.get` calls `java_actions.ask(cell_index)` which goes
through `ModelActions.ask(cellId)`, registering read dependencies in QueryContext for
waitUntil (Phase 4, roadmap §7).
